Streamers utilizing programs such as Open Broadcaster Software can add a Window Capture overlay that can target a color range for a "green screen" effect. 

## Using Smash Goals

Users can add new goals at the bottom of the form. Deleting or Editing goals is done by clicking on the text. 

Goals don't save or persist however, so once the user leaves the window everything will reset. Further development will target providing a back-end and adding more features, such as dragging and sorting goals. 

## Development
Smash Goals primarily utilizes the React library. CSS and design emulated wonderfully by Agape!
