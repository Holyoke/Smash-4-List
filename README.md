Smash Goals is a simple web-app where streamers can add a Smash-flavored goals list overlay on top of their stream.

Streamers utilizing programs such as [Open Broadcaster Software](https://obsproject.com/) can add a Window Capture overlay that can target a color range for a "green screen" effect.

## Usage

Users can add new goals at the bottom of the form. Deleting or Editing goals is done by clicking on the text.

Goals don't save or persist however, so once the user leaves the window everything will reset. Further development will target providing a back-end and adding more features, such as dragging and sorting goals.

## Tools used
Smash Goals primarily utilizes the React library. CSS and design emulated wonderfully by [@sdvim](https://github.com/sdvim)!

## Current Development
- Add a Minecraft themed menu
- Add Jest for testings

Further features in consideration are :  
- Adding a `completed` feature
- Setting up a back-end so users can sign up and save their goals  
- Dragging goals to different orders
- Adding a menu to sort,filter, and reset goals
- Adding different Smash inspired skins
